=== WELCOME ===

This is my journey towards learning Python 2 from
learnpythonthehardway.org

Each .py file contains code from the lpthw exercises
arranged sequentially according to the exercise numbers.
The files having a, b, c, etc. at the end of their names
respectively are the files on which "Study drills" have
been performed and hence modified.
